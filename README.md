### 1 - What is NCS?
NCS stands for Nightcore Community Script. It was originally written back in 2015 when Plug.dj shut down the first time.

### 2 - Why Rewritten?
The original NCS code is very sloppy, and hard to read, let alone write on again. This was written when I was quite new to programming as a whole, and it could be done much more efficently and much better, with more features. Of course, the original NCS couldn't have been done without my friends from the time, whom I wish I could still be in touch with. I own them a lot, and I hope they come back and talk to me, and maybe help with this one day.

### 4 - What does NCS aim to do?
NCS aims to be a full replacement for RCS (Radiant Community Script) from Plug.dj, but for Musiqpad. With Plug.dj now gone a second time, users on Nightcore-331 are going to want some sort of feature extension script.

I can't emphasise enough how much I miss you guys, and how greatful I am to have been friends with you. You helped me become as successful in life as a whole as I am today, rather then the no life I was back then. Thank you all for the good times, and I hope to see you again, one day. <3
